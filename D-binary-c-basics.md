# Recitation 3 #

## Data Types: Numbers ##

Integer Types:

  - char
  - int

Modifiers (and sugar):

  - short
  - long

Memory size for each type depends on system, and only restrictions are that

    char <= short <= int <= long <= long long

CLIC machines follow

  - char = 1 byte
  - short = 2 bytes
  - int = 4 bytes
  - long = 8 (these last two vary from system to system a lot)
  - long long = 8 

Test it out for yourself:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
 int main(int argc, char** argv) {
   printf("char: %d\n
     short: %d\n
     int: %d\n
     long: %d\n
     longlong: %d\n",
     sizeof(char), sizeof(short), sizeof(int), sizeof(long), sizeof(long long));
   return 0;
}
```

Here are some declarations to help you understand what really happens when we're talking characters and integers. Definitely take a look at 
[The Ascii Table](http://www.asciitable.com) and understand the relationships 
in theorder of the first 128 ascii characters. The C language is built on a 
subset of 7-bit ascii (0-127) so its important to know what the table is like, 
not to memorize it. Also note that in C, single quotes means a character.

Declaration     | x (dec) | y (dec)
--------------- | ------- | -------
int x;          | NULL    | -
int x, y;       | NULL    | NULL
int x = 0, y;   | 0       | NULL
char x = 'x';   | 120     | -
char x = '\n';  | 10      | -
char x = '\13'; | 11      | -
char x = '0';   | 48      | -
char x = '\0';  | 0       | -
char x = 0;     | 0       | -
long x = 0L;    | 0       | -

Preceding a constant with 0x denotes hexadecimal notation:

    (0xFFFFFFFF == -1); //returns 1 (which is true, but C doesn't have true)
    (037777777777 == -1); //returns 1 (true)
    sizeof(1234L); //returns 8
    sizeof(1234); //returns 4
    0xFFFFU; //returns 65535
    0177777U; //returns 65535

Also not that converting a signed value to an unsigned value or vice verse
preserves the bit pattern:

```c
  char c = -1; //0xFF
  unsigned char uc = c; //0xFF
  int i = uc; //i == 255
```

Float and double are the two floating point types (decimal) and can be 
expressedwith a decimal point or as scientific notation:

    float miles = 1.8;
    double big = 1e10;

The only implementation constraint is that

    float <= double <= long double

so they could all be one size, or be three distinct sizes.

In C there is no such thing as a string, just an array and pointers.
Essentially, a bunch of single characters located consecutively in memory will
make up a string, but more on this later.


## Expressions ##

    char *myString = "Here's a string!" //string literal
    int x = 10; //variable declaration and assignment
    int x; //variable declaration
    x = 30; //variable assignment: lvalue = rvalue

The order of the increment/decrement operators in C matters:

    int x = 1;
    int y = x++; // y==1
    y = ++x; // y==3

Valid binary operators in order of increasing precedence:

  - + -
  - * / %

The positive and negative operators are more tightly binding than any of the
above operators (+/-).

Comparison operators:

  - < > <= >=

All of these comparison operators have the same precedence, and are more tightly
binding than the equality and inequality operators (==/!=).

The logical operators are `||` for or, `&&` for and, and `!` for not. The "or"
and "and" operators short-circuit.

[Bitwise operators](recitation-2.md#bitwise-operators) are tricky and can be 
used for a variety of purposes. See the examples in the recitation 2 notes for 
a refresher.

Ternary operator:

```c
x = a ? b : c;
```

is the same thing as this:

```c
if(a)
  x = b;
else
  x = c;
```

Note that any integer is also a boolean!! 0 is false, any other number is true!


## Statements ##

### If-Else Statements ###

```c
if(condition)
  if(condition2) {
    printf("conditions met");
    return 0;
  }
  else
    printf("no conditions met");
```

### Switch Statements ###

```c
switch(v)
  case 1: // v == 1
    printf("v is 1");
    break;
  case 2:
    printf("v is 2");
    break;
  default:
    printf("v is neither 1 nor 2");
end
```

### Loops ###

```c
int i;
for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // do things here
}
while(i) { //condition checked at the beginning
    //other things
    i--;
}

do {
    //more things
} while(i < 5); //condition is checked at the end
```

Using `break;` inside a loop will break out of the innermost loop. Using
`continue;` will stop executing the current iteration of the loop and skip to
the next iteration. `for(;;)` is an idiom for an infinite loop. `goto label`
will jump to a line beginning with `label: `. Be careful with gotos.
