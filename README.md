This repository contains the recitation notes for Columbia's Advanced
Programming Class, COMSW3157, as taught by Jae Woo Lee. For more information
about the class, visit the [course homepage](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/3157).

These recitations are held weekly by the various TAs, generally using these
notes as the basis for their sections. Issues, patches, and comments, especially
by current and former students, are welcome.

Contents:

* [Recitation A](A-unix.md): Introduction to UNIX, compile your first C
  program. Be sure to have a CLIC account from CRF before the recitation.
* [Recitation B](B-makefiles.md): Makefiles. 
    * You may find the [sample-Makefile](sample-Makefile) a useful reference.
* [Recitation C](C-git.md): Configuring and using Git for version control and file tracking.
* [Recitation D](D-binary-c-basics.md): C Basics: data types, bitwise, complex expressions and statements.
    * See also the Recitation 2 practice exercise, under
      [practice/recitation-2/](practice/recitation-2/)
* [Recitation E](E-memory-pointers.md): Parts of memory, pointers, and arrays.
(i.e. malloc).
    * See also the very useful [E-code](E-code/) directory,
      especially `pointerfun.c` and its output `pointerfun-output` for some
      interesting experiments with pointers and memory addresses.
* [Recitation F](F-function-pointers.md): Function pointers. Basic File input/output.
* [Recitation G](G-structs-unions.md): Strucuts, Unions, Const, C strings.
* [Recitation H](H-linked-lists.md): Linked Lists and similar data structures.
* [Recitation I](I-debugging.md) Using GDB and valgrind for debugging.
* [Recitation J](J-unix-fork-exec.md): The UNIX stack. Users, permissions, file
  attributes. Processes, forking, and signals. TCP/IP and netcat basics.
    * See also `jsh`, the Jae shell, in the [J-code](J-code/)
      directory for a fun example of forking.
* [Recitation K](K-io.md): `size_t`. File IO, including reading, writing,
  and seeking in files.
* [Recitation L](L-tcpip.md): TCP/IP stack information. 
* [Recitation M](M-cpp.md): C++. Classes/Structs. Stack vs heap allocation
  in C++. The basic 4. Implicit conversion and operator overloading.
* [Recitation N](N-templates-containers.md): C++ generics, templates,
  containers, metaprogramming
* [Recitation O](O-smart-pointer.md): Smart Pointer
